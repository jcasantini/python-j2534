# This is a j2534 interface library for Python

These scripts are for testing purposes ONLY at this time. Still waiting for my interface to actually confirm that I can communicate with it.

They assume an openport with a dll located in:
"C:/Program Files (x86)/OpenECU/OpenPort 2.0/drivers/openport 2.0/"

And they only work with a 32bit python version right now.
